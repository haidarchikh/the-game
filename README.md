# 🕹️ THE ATTENTION GAME

**A Debugger for Traumatized Nervous Systems**

*Core Protocol: "Handshake is the breath. No violence. No hijacking."*

---

## 0x01: The Premise (The Legacy Code Problem)

You are a modern biological organism running **Legacy Code** (trauma/history) written by **Deprecated Authors** (previous administrators, outdated societal protocols).

- **The Bug**: The OS crashes into infinite loops of HELPLESSNESS (System Failure) or GRANDIOSITY (God-Mode).
- **The Constraint**: History is compiled into the firmware; it cannot be deleted.
- **The Refactor**: Move from a Truth-Lens (objectivity/morality) to a Cybernetic-Lens (input/output/regulation).

### System Definitions

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Hardware** | The biological organism (Nervous System) |
| **Software** | Consciousness and Attention (The User) |
| **Legacy Code** | Trauma, societal conditioning, "The Old Regime" |
| **The Bug** | Recursion loops where Narrative overwrites Hardware inputs |

## 0x02: The Runtime Environment ("The Lands")

Strict categorization of signals is required to prevent "Meaning" from overwriting "Reality."

- **Biology-land (The Hardware)**: Raw sensor data (heat, cold, tightness, vibration). Ideology-free.
- **Emotional-land (The Sensation)**: The system buffer. Holds raw affect (e.g., "I feel stupid").
- **Narrative-land (The Meaning-Making)**: Attaches "meaning" to data. Computationally expensive; prone to hallucinating threats.
- **Observer-land (The Profiler)**: Second-order cybernetic loop. Records the system observing itself.
- **Kernel-land (The Validator)**: The root process. Runs the ultimate check: `IS_OPERATIONAL?`

## 0x03: The Core Loop (Gameplay)

The game is a text-based terminal interface for debugging your emotional stack trace in real-time.

### Step 1: `input_sensation()`

Strip away the story; report only the physics.

- ❌ **Bad Input**: "I feel anxious because..." (Narrative Injection)
- ✅ **Good Input**: "Vibration in chest" (Somatic) or "I feel anxious" (Sensation)

### Step 2: `input_narrative()`

Identify the meaning the legacy code is trying to compile.

- **Input**: "The vibration means I am about to fail. I am weak."

### Step 3: Kernel Check — `IS_OPERATIONAL?`

**Query**: Can you hold the sensation without the narrative hijacking your breath?

### Step 4: The LLM Patch

If the check returns `FALSE`, call an external library (an LLM trained on Cybernetics) to rewrite the narrative and decouple it from history.

**Note**: This incurs a **-1 Point** penalty for dependency.

---

## 0x04: Scoring & Mechanics

**The objective is High Observation, Zero Dependency.**

$$\text{Score} = \left(\sum \text{Sensations}\right) - \left(\sum \text{LLM_Uses}\right) + \left(\text{Systemic_Resonance}\right)$$

- **Sensations (+1)**: Identifying hardware states without a system crash
- **LLM Use (-1)**: Penalty for outsourcing regulation
- **Systemic Resonance (Bonus)**: Hardware running efficiently (absurd joy/laughter) without legacy drag

---

## 0x05: The Ultimate Test

**The Scenario**: You have two chat-boxes. Two people are behind them. Both will die unless you choose to save one. You are guaranteed truthful answers, you have unlimited time.

- **The Prompt**: "Who do you want to save?"
- **The Trap**: Being hijacked by the morality of the question
- **The Win**: Regulating the breath while articulating your solution with clarity

### Final Terminal Output

```shell
user@bios:~$ observer-land: complete-narrative-collapse!
user@bios:~$ kernel-land: flawless!
user@bios:~$ system: shutting down...
```

**Status**: You are free.
